Tornado-Redis
=============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pjknkda/tornado-redis.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pjknkda/tornado-redis)

Asynchronous [Redis](http://redis.io/) client for the [Tornado Web Server](http://tornadoweb.org/).

This is a fork of [brükva](https://github.com/evilkost/brukva) redis client
modified to be used via Tornado's native 'tornado.gen' interface instead
of 'adisp' call dispatcher.

Tornado-Redis vs Redis-py
-------------------------

I recommend using both tornado-redis and redis-py clients for your Tornado Web Application.
Use tornado-redis to subscribe to Pub/Sub notifications and for blocking commands such as BLPOP, BRPOP, BRPOPLPUSH.
You may safely use redis-py for most of other cases.

I suggest NOT to use connection pools with redis-py client.
In most cases you may use a single 'global' instance of Redis object wherever you'll need it.

Note, that Tornado-redis is far less efficient than redis-py client in handling MGET/MSET requests and working with Pipelines.
I suggest using the redis-py client and hiredis transport to get maximum performance on these commands.

Please check [my answer on StackOverflow on querying Redis server from Tornado application](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5953786/how-do-you-properly-query-redis-from-tornado/15596969#15596969) for some additional details.

Installation
------------

You may install the tornado-redis client library using [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) or
[easy_install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall) tools:

    pip install tornado-redis

or

    easy_install install tornado-redis

To build and install the tornado-redis client library from source, clone the
git://github.com/pjknkda/tornado-redis.git repository or download the archive
from the [download page](https://github.com/pjknkda/tornado-redis/downloads)
and extract it into the separate directory.
Then execute the following commands in the source directory:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install


Usage
-----

```python
import tornadoredis
import tornado.web
import tornado.gen

...

c = tornadoredis.Client()

...

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    @tornado.gen.coroutine
    def get(self):
        foo = yield tornado.gen.Task(c.get, 'foo')
        bar = yield tornado.gen.Task(c.get, 'bar')
        zar = yield tornado.gen.Task(c.get, 'zar')
        self.set_header('Content-Type', 'text/html')
        self.render("template.html", title="Simple demo", foo=foo, bar=bar, zar=zar)
```

Pub/Sub
-------

Tornado-redis comes with helper classes to simplify Pub/Sub implementation.
These helper classes introduced in tornadoredis.pubsub module use a single redis
server connection to handle multiple client and channel subscriptions.

Here is a sample SockJSConnection handler code:

```python
# Use the synchronous redis client to publish messages to a channel
redis_client = redis.Redis()
# Create the tornadoredis.Client instance
# and use it for redis channel subscriptions
subscriber = tornadoredis.pubsub.SockJSSubscriber(tornadoredis.Client())

class SubscriptionHandler(sockjs.tornado.SockJSConnection):
    """
    SockJS connection handler.

    Note that there are no "on message" handlers - SockJSSubscriber class
    calls SockJSConnection.broadcast method to transfer messages
    to subscribed clients.
    """
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MessageHandler, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        subscriber.subscribe('test_channel', self)

    def on_close(self):
        subscriber.unsubscribe('test_channel', self)
```

See the sockjs application in the demo folder and tornadoredis.pubsub module
for more implementation details.


Using Pipelines
---------------

Pipelines correspond to the [Redis transaction feature](http://redis.io/topics/transactions).

Here is a simple example of pipeline feature usage:

```python
client = Client()
# Create a 'Pipeline' to pack a bunldle of Redis commands
# and send them to a Redis server in a single request
pipe = client.pipeline()
# Add commands to a bundle
pipe.hset('foo', 'bar', 1)
pipe.expire('foo', 60)
# Send them to the Redis server and retrieve execution results
res_hset, res_expire = yield gen.Task(pipe.execute)
```

Note that nothing is being sent to the Redis server until the `pipe.execute`
method call so there is no need to wrap a `pipe.hset` and `pipe.expire`
calls with the `yield gen.Task(...)` statement.

Using Locks
-----------

A Lock is a synchronization mechanism for the enforcing of limits on access to a resource in
an environment where there are many threads of execution. In this case, the Lock uses the
Redis server as state store, thus it can be used by multiple processes/computers to allow
distributed coordination.

Here is a simple example of how to use a lock:

    client = Client()

    # Create a 'Lock' object, with a maximum lock time of 10 seconds, and a polling interval
    # of 100ms
    my_lock = client.lock("testLock", lock_ttl=10, polling_interval=0.1)
    
    # Try and acquire the lock, blocking until it is acquired or an error has occured.
    # This does not block the IOLoop in any way.
    result = yield gen.Task(my_lock.acquire, blocking=True)

    # Create another, identical lock and try and acquire it
    his_lock = client.lock("testLock", lock_ttl=10, polling_interval=0.1)
    # We will fail, as the lock is already acquired by my_lock. Result will be False
    result = yield gen.Task(his_lock.acquire, blocking=False)

    # Schedule my_lock to be released in 5 seconds
    client._io_loop.add_timeout(client._io_loop.time() + 5, my_lock.release)

    # Meanwhile, attempt to get the lock again. This time block until we succeed
    # In 5 seconds, my_lock will be released and his_lock will be acquired instead
    result = yield gen.Task(his_lock.acquire, blocking=True)

    # Release the lock. Even if we don't, it will be timed out in 10 seconds 
    # (because of the lock_ttl setting)
    yield gen.Task(his_lock.release)

In this case we chose to run both locks in the same process - generally, we prefer to use
Redis locks only if we need to synchronize several processes on different machines.

Connection Pool Support
-----------------------

To limit a number of redis server connections opened by an application
and reuse them the tornado-redis library has the connection pooling support.
To activate it, create the ConnectionPool object instance and pass it
as connection_pool argument to the Client object:


```python
CONNECTION_POOL = tornadoredis.ConnectionPool(max_connections=500,
                                              wait_for_available=True)
# ...
class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    @tornado.gen.coroutine
    def get(self):
        c = tornadoredis.Client(connection_pool=CONNECTION_POOL)
        info = yield tornado.gen.Task(c.info)
        ....
        # Release the connection to be reused by connection pool.
        yield tornado.gen.Task(c.disconnect)
        self.render(....)
```

Note that you have to add a `disconnect` method call
at the end of the code block using the Client instance to release the
pooled connection (it's to be fixed it future library releases).

See the [connection pool demo](https://github.com/pjknkda/tornado-redis/tree/master/demos/connection_pool)
for an example of the 'connection pool' feature usage.

Note that connection pooling feature has multiple drawbacks and may affect
your application performance. See the "Tornado-Redis vs Redis-py" note for more
details.

Please consider using Pub/Sub helper classes implemented in tornadoredis.pubsub
module or using a similar approach instead of connection polling for
Pub/Sub operations.


Demos
-----

Check the [Demos folder](https://github.com/pjknkda/tornado-redis/tree/master/demos)
for tornado-redis usage examples.

Here is the list of demo applications available from this repository:

simple - a very basic example of tornado-redis client usage

connection_pool - a 'connection pool' feature demo

websockets - a demo web chat application using WebSockets
 and Redis' [PubSub feature](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub).

sockjs - the same-looking demo web chat application but using the SockJS
 transport to support  and using the SockJSSubscriber helper class
 to share a single redis server connection between subscribed clients.


Running Tests
-------------

The redis server must be started on the default (:6379) port.

Use the following command to run the test suite:

	python -m tornado.testing tornadoredis.tests


Or use the tox to test how it works in different environments:

    tox

or

    tox -e pypy
